# Datalogging

Trace A, B, and C, correspond to the telescope pointing at the Sun, sky, and ground, respectively. FileName_1 uses two ZX60-06203ALN+ LNAs and the 7.8-8.8 GHz filter. FileName_2 uses the same LNAs and a different 8-12 GHz filter. The latter trace may be unusable because the spectrum analyzer had an internal filter-shaped artifact at around 9-13 GHz.
