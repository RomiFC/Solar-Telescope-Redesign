# Solar-Telescope-Redesign

This goal of this project is to redesign and modernize a solar telescope initially created some time before 2013. The telescope receives RF energy from the sun through an x-band feed horn antenna, amplifies and rectifies the signal, then outputs the signal to a voltmeter. More information is available under the [official documentation](/Report/002.35.25.05.20-002-REP-SolarTeleRedesign.pdf).
