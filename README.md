# Solar-Telescope-Redesign

This goal of this project is to redesign and modernize a solar telescope initially created in 2013. The telescope receives RF energy from the sun through a circular x-band feed horn antenna, amplifies and rectifies the signal, then outputs a voltmeter reading on a digital screen.
