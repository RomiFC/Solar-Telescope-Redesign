# Solar-Telescope-Redesign

This goal of this project is to redesign and modernize a solar telescope initially created in 2013. The telescope receives RF energy from the sun through an x-band feed horn antenna, amplifies and rectifies the signal, then outputs the signal to a voltmeter. More information is available under the [official documentation](/Report/NRAO%20Solar%20Telescope%20Report.pdf).
